					A linear chain of amino acid residues is called a polypeptide.A protein contains at least one long polypeptide.Short polypeptides,containing less than 20-30 residues,are rarely considered to be proteins and are commonly called peptides,or sometimes oligopeptides.
				</div>
				<div class="column">
					The individual amino acid residues are bonded together by peptide bonds and adjacent amino acid residues.The sequence of amino acid residues in a protein is defined by the sequence of a gene,which is encoded in the genetic code.
				</div>
				<div class="column">
					Shortly after or even during synthesis,the residues in a protein are often chemically modified by post-translational modification,which alters the physical and chemical properties.

				<div class="flip" id="news_intro">House, also known as House, M.D., was a critically-acclaimed American medical drama television series created by David Shore and executively produced by film director Bryan Singer. The Emmy and Peabody award-winning medical drama debuted on the FOX Network on November 16, 2004, and aired its last episode on May 21, 2012.</div>
				<div>	
					<div class="info">
						House often clashes with his fellow physicians, including his own diagnostic team, because many of his hypotheses about patients' illnesses are based on subtle or controversial insights.House was among the top 10 series in the United States from its second through fourth seasons.
					</div>
					<div class="info">
						During the first three seasons, House's diagnostic team consists of Dr. Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer), Dr. Allison Cameron (Jennifer Morrison), and Dr. Eric Foreman (Omar Epps).At the end of the third season, this team disbands. Rejoined by Foreman, House gradually selects three new team members: Dr. Remy "Thirteen" Hadley (Olivia Wilde), Dr. Chris Taub (Peter Jacobson), and Dr. Lawrence Kutner (Kal Penn).

							Correction</br>
							</br>
							An alternative to correction fluid used to correct mistakes during typing, or, in some forms, handwriting. One side of the tape, which is placed against the error, is coated in a white, opaque masking material. Pressure applied to the other side of the tape transfers this material to the paper.Correction tape in its current form was invented by Japanese stationery product manufacturer Seed in 1989 and quickly spread throughout the world.
